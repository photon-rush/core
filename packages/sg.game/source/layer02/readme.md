# Layer 02: Drone Fight

The Enceladus is damaged, but for some reason is resisting attempts to repair her. Fight back against the rouge drones
and carry out repairs.

- Drone Fight has two phases: Navigation and Battle
- Resources produced by Drone Upgrades are consumed in both phases
- Navigation phase has the drone navigate a 3d maze with a cube grid.
- The player can rotate and zoom, and generally play with the maze layout
- The maze contains enemy drones, upgrades and other items useful to the player or their drone
- When the player drone encounters an enemy, the battle phase begins
- The battle phase is a simplistic RPG with various attacks useful against certain kinds of enemies
- Like pokemon, each drone has a very limited set of active moves, each with a finite charge.
