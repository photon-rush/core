# Layer 03: Hacking

Trace back the source of the drones and hack into the rouge systems.

- Another hex-grid, but this time there are both friendly and hostile buildings called nodes
- This time connections between buildings are direct, a line is draw through (only) empty cells to connect two buildings
  together (up to six connections at once)
- Each building represents a computer system.
- Connect with hostile nodes to attack and convert them
- Hostile nodes will attempt to connect to yours and convert them
- Lock down each nodeWebpack so that it cannot be converted
- The player can only connect to nodes if they are adjunct to them in the network

- Drones are the actual hackers here, they can be upgraded in Layer 01
