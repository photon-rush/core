# Layer 01: Drone Upgrades

The Enceladus is damaged! Power up the drones so they are capable of repairing her.

- The playfield is a hex-grid. The player creates a building anywhere on the grid.
- The building produces resources up to a cap.
- The building produces resources on a cycle (called a round)
- Buildings automatically "thow" resources to any building that is able to receive them within a radius.
- Some buildings need input from up to 7 nodes.
- Each recipe is a building.
- There are terminal recipes that produce resources used by the drones during battle.
- Terminal recipes are used by other recipes as well
- Buildings can output to more than one building, but their total output for the round is divided by the number of
  outgoing connections
- Buildings can receive input from more than one building, the total of each input is added up

## Upgrades

- Unlock new buildings to gain new resources
- Unlock new buildings to gain the same resources more efficiently
- Improve the production rate of buildings
- Improve the transfer time between buildings
- Improve the holding capacity of buildings
- Improve the quantity produced each round.
- Improve the build limit

## Look & Feel

- Transfers are should by glowing light that transfers between buildings, sort of like a fuse, but intermittent
- The grid isn't visible (by default) but the player can zoom in and out
