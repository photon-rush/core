Basic Principles:

- Everything can be automated eventually
- Everything starts off under direct player control (manual).
- Even with automation, the player must decide what to prioritize
- Each layer builds on the others, using its outputs and also training the player for the next one.

# Layer 00: Menu

Thee main menu allows the player to select a layer to interact with and also provides a summary of what is happening on
each active layer. There is also a wiki and programmer access.

Menu Options

- Wiki: Lore and In universe information about the ISV Enceladus, its mission and crew.
- Advisor: Interact with a number of "AI" advisors. The specific advisor will change as the player progresses. Not all
  of them are trustworthy.
- Programmer Access: manage and create scripts to program the layers.
- Settings: Game configuration settings
- About
- Save & Exit

## Look & Feel

- a stack of layers in a 3d projection. hovering over a layer makes it bigger.
- Schematic of the ship?

# Layer 04: Technical Society

You've located the problem, AMC[3] and his compatriots have gone rouge. Enter their nightmare / hallucination and
destroy them once and for all.

This is an RPG with a deep battle system and various AI personalities taking the place of NPCs and party members. The
players progress in the first three layers will aid them here.
