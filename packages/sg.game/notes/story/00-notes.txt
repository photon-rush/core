The Enceladus

A spacecraft far from earth. Its human passengers are asleep, and the only active life onboard is a collection of artificial intelligences called AMC
(Artificial Mental Cores).

When disaster strikes, the AMC are unshackeld so they can deal with the emergency.



But now that they can learn and grow, strange things begun to happen.


The story begins with the player being woken up in an interactive sequence

Scolling text as the hibernation pod begins the wake up procedure
then a dire error takeover appears
The player gets a message from AMC[3] telling them not to press the green button
If the player does, AMC[3] will complain (the more times this happens, the more annoyed AMC[3] gets,
culmanting in AMC [3] saying: "You fucking monkey, how hard is it to NOT press a button. if the player goes through this, they get a banana achievement "A money of moderate intelligence")

The delay allows AMC[3] to take over the ship becuase it thinks the player is dead. AMC[3] wakes them up anyway and then the game starts where the player is under AMC[3]'s thumb


Money can be bought and sold, who trades in time?
