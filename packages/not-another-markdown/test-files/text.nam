** Not Strong**

__Not Another Markdown__ files are like markdown, but they have a number of differences that make them safer, easier to parse. They also have a number of additional features that are commonly requested by developers, like definition lists and metadata.

The **biggest** difference between NAM and Markdown is that NAM does not support parsing arbitrary HTML elements. These are _always_ treated as plain text must be escaped when rendering NAM to HTML. There are a few other things that have been removed from markdown

NAM files also allow you to do some preprocessing, by supporting specific language for file importing.

NAM isn't a strict superset of Markdown, but many, and perhaps most Markdown files you encounter in the wild can be parsed as NAM.
